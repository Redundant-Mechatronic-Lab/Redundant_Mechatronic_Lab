        <p>At <a href="#page-top">Redundant Mechatronic Lab</a>, we are dedicated to the <strong>design and development of advanced manufacturing tools</strong>, emphasizing precision, performance, and scalability. Our work is driven by a deep technical understanding of mechatronics, materials, and control systems, enabling the creation of highly optimized industrial solutions.</p>
        
        <p>We believe that <strong>transparency and accessibility</strong> are key to meaningful innovation. While we respect intellectual property and industry-specific licensing, we actively contribute to the <strong>open-source ecosystem</strong>, sharing knowledge and methodologies that benefit both independent developers and industrial partners.</p>
        
        <p>Many of our projects are available under two compartments: <strong>open-access</strong> and <strong>licensed collaboration models</strong>, allowing for flexible adoption and integration into commercial and research applications. We welcome <strong>partnerships, contributions, and discussions</strong> on technology development and optimization. If you're interested in working with us, <a href="#contact">get in touch</a>.</p>
